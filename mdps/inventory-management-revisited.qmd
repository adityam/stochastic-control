# <i class="bi bi-journal-text text-primary"></i> Summary
One of the potential benefits of modeling a system as infinite horizon discounted cost MDP is that it can be simpler to identify an optimal policy. We illustrate this using the inventory management example.
:::

Consider the model for [inventory management] and assume that it runs for an
infinite horizon. We assume that the per-step cost is given by
$$c(s,a,s_{+}) = p a + γ h(s), $$
where 
$$ h(s) = \begin{cases}
  c_h s, & \text{if $s \ge 0$} \\
  -c_s s, & \text{if $s < 0$},
\end{cases}$$
where $a$ is the per-unit holding cost, $b$ is the per-unit shortage cost, and
$p$ is the per-unit procurement cost. Note that in the per-step cost, we are
assuming that the holding or shortage cost is dicounted because this cost is
incurred at the end of the time period.  

Recall that in the finite horizon setting, the optimal policy was a
_base-stock_ policy characterized by thresholds $\{s^*_t\}_{t \ge 1}$. In the
infinite horizon discounted setting, we expect the optimal policy to be
time-homogeneous, i.e., the thresholds $\{s^*_t\}_{t \ge 1}$ be a constant
$s^*$ and not to depend on time.

As an illustration, let's reconsider the example used for the [finite horizon
setting][finite] (where $p=5$, $c_h = 4$, $c_s = 2$, and the demand is
Binomial(10,0.4)). We consider the discount factor $γ = 0.9$. The value
function and optimal policy is this case are shown below.

We are interested in the following question: _Is it possible to identify the optimal threshold of the base-stock policy without explicitly solving the dynamic program?_ In this section, we show that the answer is affirmative.

As a first step, we modify the per-step cost using [reward shaping]. In
particular, we consider the following potential function

$$\varphi(s) = h(s) + \frac1{γ} p s - \frac{1}{1-γ}p\mu,$$
where $\mu = \EXP[W]$ is the expected number of arrivals at each time period. 

Now consider a new cost function
$$\begin{align*}
  c'(s,a,s_{+}) &= c(s,a,s_{+}) + \varphi(s) - γ \varphi(s_{+}) \\
  &= pa + γ h(s_{+}) + h(s) + \frac{1}{γ} p s - \frac{1}{1-γ} p \mu
  - γ h(s_{+}) - p s_{+} - \frac{γ}{1-γ} p \mu \\
  &= h(s) + \frac{1-γ}{γ} ps + p w - p \mu.
\end{align*} $$
Note that 
$$ \EXP[ c'(s,a,S_{+}) | S = s, A = a ] = h(s) + \frac{1-γ}{γ} ps 
=: c^*(s). $$
Thus, the optimal policy of the original model is the same as that in which
the per-step cost is given by $c^*(s)$. 

Recall that the optimal policy in the original model was a base stock 
policy. For the infinite horizon model, the threshold will become
time-invariant. Thus, the optimal policy will be of the form
$$
  π(s) = \begin{cases}
  s^* - s, & \text{if $s \le s^*$} \\
  0, & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}$$

The infinite horizon dynamic programming with this modified cost is given by 
$$\begin{equation}\label{eq:DP}
  V(s) = \min_{a \in \reals_{\ge 0}} 
   \bigl\{ c^*(s) + γ \EXP[ V(s + a - W) ] \bigr\}. 
\end{equation}$$

Using the structure of the optimal policy identified above, we have two
properties. First,
$$\begin{equation}\label{eq:opt}
V(s) = c^*(s) + γ \EXP[ V(s^* - W) ], \qquad s \le s^*.
\end{equation}$$
Second, at $s = 0$, $π(0) = s^*$ (and recall that $c^*(0) = 0$). Therefore,
$$\begin{equation}\label{eq:opt-policy}
  s^* = \arg\min_{a \in \reals_{\ge 0}} γ \EXP[V(a - W)]
\end{equation}$$

Let $F(s^*)$ denote $\EXP[V(s^*-W)]$. Then, substituting $s = s^* - W$ in 
\\eqref{eq:opt} and taking expectations, we get
$$F(s^*) = \EXP[ c^*(s^* - W) ] + γ F(s^*).$$
Thus, 
$$ \EXP[V(s^* - W)] = F(s^*) = \frac{1}{1-γ} \EXP[ c^*(s^*-W) ]. $$

Substituting the above in \\eqref{eq:opt-policy}, we get
$$ s^* = \arg\min_{s^* \ge 0} \frac{γ}{1-γ} \EXP[ c^*(s^* - W) ].$$
Consequently, we have the following:

::: {#thm-inventory-inf}
The optimal threshold $s^*$ is given by the value of $s^*$ which minimizes $\EXP[ c^*(s^*-W) ]$. In particular, if $F$ denotes the CDF of the demand, then
$$\begin{equation}
 s^* = F^{-1}\left( \frac{c_s - p(1-γ)/γ}{c_h + c_s} \right).
 \label{eq:opt-threshold}
\end{equation}$$

#### Proof {-}
The proof idea is the same approach as that used for the [newsvendor
problem](../stochastic/newsvendor.html). In particular, let $f$ denote the
distribution of $W$, $F$ denote the CDF, and $μ = \EXP[W]$. Then,
$$\begin{align}
\EXP[c^*(s^*-W)] &= \EXP[h(s^*-W)] + \frac{1-γ}{γ}p(s^* - μ) 
\notag \\
&= \int_{0}^{s^*} c_h(s^*-w)f(w)dw + 
   \int_{s^*}^{∞} c_s(w-s^*)f(w)dw + \frac{1-γ}{γ}p(s^* - μ) \notag
\end{align}$$
Thereore, 
$$\begin{align}
\frac{∂ \EXP[c^*(s^*-W)]}{∂s^*} &=
  \int_{0}^{s^*} c_h f(w)dw
+ \int_{s^*}^{\infty}[-c_s] f(w)dw 
+ \frac{1-γ}{γ}p \notag \\
&= c_h F(s^*) - c_s(1 - F(s^*))
+ \frac{1-γ}{γ}p \notag \\
\end{align}$$
To find the optimal threshold, we set the derivative to $0$ and simplify to
obtain \\eqref{eq:opt-threshold}.

:::

We can use \\eqref{eq:opt-threshold} to find the optimal threshold for the
example used above. In particular, we need to find the value of $s^*$ at which
the CDF of the demand equals the value $(c_s - p(1-γ)/γ)/(c_h + c_s)$, as
shown in Fig. 2 below.

## Exercises {-}

:::{#exr-inventory-exponential}
Suppose that the arrival process is exponential with rate $1/\mu$, i.e.,
the density of $W$ is given by $e^{-s/\mu}/\mu$. Show that the optimal
threshold is given by
$$ s^* = \mu \log \left[ \frac{ c_h + c_s} { c_h + p (1-γ)/γ} \right]. $$

 _Hint_: Recall that the CDF the exponential distribution is
 $F(s) = 1 - e^{-s/μ}$.

## Notes {-}

The idea of using [reward shaping] to derive a closed form expression for inventory management is taken from @Whittle1982. It is interesting to note that @Whittle1982 uses the idea of reward shaping more than 17 years before the paper by @Ng1999 on reward shaping. It is possible that Whittle was using the results of @Porteus1975.
