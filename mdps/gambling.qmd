# <i class="bi bi-journal-text text-primary"></i> Summary
This stylized model of optimal gambling was introduced by @Kelly1956
to highlight a relationship between channel capacity (which had been proposed
recently by Shannon), and gambling. Our motivation for studying this model is
to use it as an illustrative example to show that sometimes it is possible to
identify the optimal strategy and value function of MDPs in closed form.
:::

Imagine  a gambler who goes to a casino with an initial fortune of $s_1$
dollars and places bets over time and must leave after $T$ bets. Let $S_t$
denote the gambler's fortune after $t$ bets. In this example, time denotes the
number of times that the gambler has bet.

At time $t$, the gambler may place a bet for any amount $A_t$ less than or
equal to his
current fortune $S_t$. If he wins the bet (denoted by the event $W_t = 1$), the
casino gives him the amount that he had bet. If he loses the bet (denoted by
the event $W_t = -1$), he pays the casino the amount that he had bet. Thus,
the dynamics can be written as 

$$ S_{t+1} = S_t + W_t A_t. $$

The outcomes of the bets $\{W_t\}_{t \ge 1}$ are _primitive random variables_,
i.e., they are independent of each other, the gambler's initial fortune, and
his betting strategy. 

The gambler's utility is $\log S_T$, the logarithm of his final fortune.[^1] Thus,
the reward function may be written as

$$ r_t(s, a) = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad r_T(s) = \log s.
$$

[^1]: See the notes on [risk sensitive utility] for a discussion on the choice of the utility function but one way to think of the reward is as follows. Suppose we put $S_1$ dollars in a bank and accrue continuously compounded interest of $R$ per unit time, we will get $S_1 e^{RT}$ dollars after $T$ time steps. Thus, we may view $\log(S_T/S_1)$ to be the effective (random) interest rate.

    For an interesting discussion on the impact of the utility function on optimal gambling, see [this post on less wrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JAmyTWoukk8xzhE9n/ruining-an-expected-log-money-maximizer)

Find the strategy that maximizes the gambler's utility, $\EXP[\log S_T]$. 

## Computational experiment

To fix ideas, let's try to find the optimal policy on our own. An example
strategy is given below.

```{ojs}
viewof code = Inputs.textarea({label: "", height:800, rows:11, width: 800, submit: true,
   value: `// function bet(t, states, outcomes) {
// t: current time
// states: Array of states
// outcomes: Array of outcomes
// 
// modify the (javascript) code between the lines:
// ===============================
     // As an illustration, we implement the policy to bet
     //  half of the wealth as long as one is winning. 
     if(t == 0) { 
        return 0.5*states[t] 
     } else { 
        return outcomes[t-1] == 1 ? 0.5*states[t] : 0
     }
// ================================
//}`
                              })
viewof strategy = Inputs.radio(["user code", "optimal"], {value: "user code", label: "Select strategy"})
```

```{ojs}
T = 100
n = 25
S1 = 100

Bernoulli = function(p) { return Math.random() <= p ? 1 : -1 }

user_strategy = new Function('t', 'states', 'outcomes', code)

optimal_strategy = function(t,states,outcomes) {
  return p < 0.5 ? 0 : (2*p - 1)*states[t]
}

bet = function(t, states, outcomes) {
  return strategy == "optimal" ? optimal_strategy(t, states, outcomes) : user_strategy(t, states, outcomes) 
}

data = { 
  run;
  var states = new Array(T+1)
  var outcomes = new Array(T+1)
  var trajectory = new Array(T+1)
  var sum = 0

  const initial = 100
  var idx = 0

  for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      // Initialize the array to NaN values.
      for (var t = 0; t < T+1; t++) {
        states[t] = NaN
        outcomes[t] = Bernoulli(p)
      }
    
      states[0] = initial
      var action = 0
    
      for (var t = 0; t < T; t++, idx++) {
        action = bet(t, states, outcomes)
        states[t+1] = states[t] + outcomes[t] * action
        trajectory[idx] = { 
          time: t+1, 
          state: states[t],
          action: action, 
          outcome: outcomes[t],
          reward: Math.log10(states[t]),
          sample: i,
        }
      }
      sum += Math.log10(states[T])
  }
  return { trajectories: trajectory, mean: sum/n }
}
```
Assuming that $S_1 = $ ${S1}, we plot the performance of this policy below. Choosing "optimal" in the radio button above gives the performance of the optimal policy (derived below). 

```{ojs}
//| layout-ncol: 2

viewof p = Inputs.range([0, 1], {value: 0.6, label: "p", step: 0.01})

viewof run = Inputs.button("Re-run simulation")
```

```{ojs}
//| label: fig-gambling
//| fig-cap-location: margin
//| fig-cap: "Plot of the performance of the strategy for a horizon of $T=$ ${T}. The curves in gray show the performance over $n = $ ${n} difference sample paths and the red curve shows its mean. For ease of visualization, we are plotting the utility at each stage (i.e., $\\log s_t$), even though the reward is only received at the terminal time step. The red line shows the mean performance over the $n$ sample paths. The final mean value of the reward is shown in red. You can toggle the select strategy button to see how the optimal strategy performs (and how close you came to it)."

rewardPlot = Plot.plot({
  grid: true,
  marginRight: 40,
  marks: [
    // Data
    Plot.line(data.trajectories, {x: "time", y: "reward", z: "sample", stroke: "gray", curve: "step-after"}),
    Plot.line(data.trajectories, Plot.groupX({y: "mean"}, {x:"time", y: "reward", stroke: "red", strokeWidth: 2, curve: "step-after"})),

    // Final value
    Plot.dot([ [T,data.mean] ], { fill: "red"}),
    Plot.text([ [T,data.mean] ], { text: Math.round(data.mean*100)/100, dx:18, fill:"red", fontWeight:"bold" }),
    // Axes
    Plot.ruleX([0]),
    Plot.ruleY([0]),
  ]
})
```

As we can see, most intuitive policies do not do so well. We will now see how
to compute the optimal policy using dynamic programming.

## Optimal gambling strategy and value functions

The above model of optimal gambling is a Markov decision process. Therefore,
the optimal solution is given by dynamic programming. 

::: {#prp-optimal-gambling-DP}
# Dynamic programming decomposition

Define the following value function $V_t \colon \reals_{\ge 0} \to \reals$
$$ V_T(s) = \log s $$
and for $t \in \{T-1, \dots, 1\}$:
$$ \begin{align*}
Q_t(s,a) &= \EXP[ r_t(s,a) + V_{t+1}(S_{t+1}) \,|\, S_t = s, A_t = a] \\
&= p V_{t+1}(s+a) + (1-p) V_{t+1}(s-a),
\end{align*}
$$
and
$$ \begin{align*}
V_t(s) &=  \max_{a \in [0, s]} Q_t(s,a), \\
π_t(s) &= \arg \max_{a \in [0, s]} Q_t(s,a). \\
\end{align*}
$$

Then the strategy $π = (π_1, \dots, π_{T-1})$ is optimal.
:::

::: {.callout-note}
# Remark

The above model is one of the rare instances when the optimal strategy and
the optimal strategy and value function of an MDP can be identified in
closed form.

:::


::: {#thm-optimal-gambling-structure}

# Optimal gambling strategy

When $p \le 0.5$:

- the optimal strategy is to _not gamble_, specifically $π_t(s) = 0$;
- the value function is $V_t(s) = \log s$. 

When $p > 0.5$:

- the optimal strategy is _to bet a fraction of the current fortune_,
specifically $π_t(s) = (2p - 1)s$;
- the value function is $V_t(s) = \log s + (T - t) C$, where
$$ C = \log 2 + p \log p + (1-p) \log (1-p).$$
:::

[The constant $C$ defined in @thm-optimal-gambling-structure is equal to the capacity of a binary symmetric channel! In fact, the above model was introduced by @Kelly1956 to show a gambling interpretation of information rates.]{.aside}



We prove the two cases separately. 

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
# Proof when $p \le 0.5$
Let $p = \PR(W_t = 1)$ and $q = \PR(W_t = -1)$. Then $p \le 0.5$ implies that
$p \le 1 - p = q$. 

We proceed by backward induction. For $t = T$, we have that $V_T(s) = \log s$.
This forms the basis of induction. Now assume that for $t+1$, $V_{t+1}(s) =
\log s$. Now consider

$$ Q_t(s,a) = p V_{t+1}(s+a) + qV_{t+1}(s-a). $$

Differentiating both sides w.r.t. $a$, we get
$$ \begin{align*} 
  \frac { \partial Q_t(s,a) } {\partial a} &= 
   \frac p { s + a} - \frac q { s - a } 
   \\
   & = \frac { (p - q) s - (p + q) a } { s^2 - a^2 } 
   \\
   & =
   \frac { - (q - p) s - a } {s^2 - a^2 } 
   \\
   &< 0.
  \end{align*}   
$$

This implies that $Q_t(s,a)$ is decreasing in $a$. Therefore,

$$ π_t(s) = \arg\max_{a \in [0, s]} Q_t(s,a) = 0. $$

Moreover,
$$ V_t(s) = Q_t(s, π_t(s)) = \log s.$$

This completes the induction step. 
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
# Proof when $p > 0.5$
As in the previous case, let $p = \PR(W_t = 1)$ and $q = \PR(W_t = -1)$. Then
$p > 0.5$ implies that $p > 1 - p = q$. 

We proceed by backward induction. For $t = T$, we have that $V_T(s) = \log s$.
This forms the basis of induction. Now assume that for $t+1$, $V_{t+1}(s) =
\log s + (T -t - 1)C$. Now consider

$$ Q_t(s,a) = p V_{t+1}(s+a) + qV_{t+1}(s-a). $$

Differentiating both sides w.r.t. $a$, we get
$$ \begin{align*} 
  \frac { \partial Q_t(s,a) } {\partial a} &= 
   \frac p { s + a} - \frac q { s - a } 
   \\
   & = \frac { (p - q) s - (p + q) a } { s^2 - a^2 } 
   \\
   & =
   \frac { (p - q) s - a } {s^2 - a^2 } 
  \end{align*}   
$$

Setting $\partial Q_t(s,a)/\partial a = 0$, we get that the optimal action is

$$ π_t(s) = (p-q) s. $$

Note that $(p-q) \in (0,1]$ 

$$ 
  \frac { \partial^2 Q_t(s,a) } {\partial a^2} = 
   - \frac p { (s + a)^2 } - \frac q { (s - a)^2 } 
  < 0;
$$
hence the above action is indeed the maximizer. 
Moreover,
$$ \begin{align*} 
  V_t(s) &= Q_t(s, π_t(s))  \\
  &= p V_{t+1}(s + π_t(s)) + q V_{t+1}( s - π_t(s) )\\
  &= \log s + p \log (1 + (p-q)) + q \log (1 - (p-q)) + (T - t -1)C \\
  &= \log s + p \log 2p + q \log 2q + (T - t + 1)C \\
  &= \log s + (T - t) C
  \end{align*}   
$$

This completes the induction step.

## Generalized model

Suppose that the terminal reward $r_T(s)$ is monotone increasing[^increasing] in $s$.

[^increasing]: I use the convention that _increasing_ means _weakly
  increasing_. The alternative term _non-decreasing_ implicitly assumes that
  we are talking about a totally ordered set. 

::: {#thm-optimal-gambling-generalized}

For the generalized optimal gambling problem:

- For each $t$, the value function $V_t(s)$ is monotone increasing in $s$.
- For each $s$, the value function $V_t(s)$ is monotone decreasing in $t$.

:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
# Proof of monotonicity in $s$ 

We proceed by backward induction. $V_T(s) = r_T(s)$ which is monotone
increasing in $s$. Assume that $V_{t+1}(s)$ is increasing in $s$. Now,
consider $V_t(s)$. Consider $s_1, s_2 \in \reals_{\ge 0}$ such that $s_1 \le
s_2$. Then for any $a \le s_1$, we have that

$$ \begin{align*}
    Q_t(s_1, a) &= p V_{t+1}(s_1+a) + q V_{t+1}(s_1-a) \\
    & \stackrel{(a)}{\le} p V_{t+1}(s_2 + a) + q V_{t+1}(s_2  - a) \\
    & = Q_t(s_2, a),
  \end{align*}
$$
where $(a)$ uses the induction hypothesis. Now consider

$$ \begin{align*}
  V_t(s_1) &= \max_{a \in [0, s_1]} Q_t(s_1, a) \\
  & \stackrel{(b)}{\le} \max_{a \in [0, s_1]} Q_t(s_2, a) \\
  & \le \max_{a \in [0, s_2]} Q_t(s_2, a) \\
  &= V_t(s_2),
  \end{align*}
$$
where $(b)$ uses monotonicity of $Q_t$ in $s$. This completes the induction
step. 
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
# Proof of monotonicity in $t$

This is a simple consequence of the following:

$$V_t(s) = \max_{a \in [0, s]} Q_t(s,a) \ge Q_t(s,0) = V_{t+1}(s).$$

## Exercises {-}

::: {.callout-note}
# Note
The purpose of these series of exercises is to generalize the basic result to
a model where the gambler can bet on many mutually exclusive outcomes (think
of betting on multiple horses in a horse race). 
:::

::: {#exr-optimal-gambling-last}
Given positive numbers $(p_1, \dots, p_n)$, consider the following
constraint optimization problem:
$$\max \sum_{i=1}^n p_i \log w_i$$
subject to:

* $w_i \ge 0$
* $\sum_{i=1}^n w_i \le s$.

Show that the optimal solution is given by
$$ w_i = \frac{p_i}{p} s$$
where $p = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i$. 
:::

::: {#exr-optimal-gambling-update}
Given positive numbers $(p_1, \dots, p_n)$, consider the following constraint optimization problem:
$$\max \sum_{i=1}^n p_i \log (s - a + na_i)$$
subject to:

* $a_i \ge 0$
* $a = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i \le s$.

Show that the optimal solution is given by
$$ a_i = \frac{p_i}{p} s$$
where $p = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i$. 
:::

::: {#exr-optimal-gambling-generalize}

Consider an alternative of the optimal gambling problem where, at each
time, the gambler can place bets on many mutually exclusive outcomes.
Suppose there are $n$ outcomes, with success probabilities $(p_1, \dots,
p_n)$. Let $(A_{1,t}, \dots, A_{n,t})$ denote the amount that the gambler
bets on each outcome. The total amount $A_t := \sum_{i=1}^n A_{i,t}$
must be less than the gambler's fortune $S_t$. If $W_t$ denotes the
winning outcome, then the gambler's wealth evolves according to
$$ S_{t+1} = S_t - A_t + nU_{W_t, t}.$$
For example, if there are three outcomes, gambler's current wealth is
$s$, the gambler bets $(a_1, a_2,
a_3)$, and outcome 2 wins, then the gambler wins $3 a_2$ and his fortune
at the next time is
$$ s - (a_1 + a_2 + a_3) + 3 a_2. $$

The gambler's utility is $\log S_T$, the logarithm of his final
wealth. Find the strategy that maximizes the gambler's expected utility. 

_Hint:_ Argue that the value function is of the form $V_t(s) = \log s +
(T -t)C$, where
[The constant $C$ is the capacity of a symmetric discrete memoryless with $n$ outputs and for every input, the output probabilities are a permutation of $(p_1, \dots, p_n)$.]{.aside}
$$C = \log n - H(p_1, \dots, p_n)$$
where $H(p_1, \dots, p_n) = - \sum_{i=1}^n p_i \log p_i$ is the entropy
of a random variable with pmf $(p_1, \dots, p_n)$.

## Notes {-}

The above model (including the model described in the exercise) was introduced
by @Kelly1956. However, Kelly restricted attention to “bet a constant fraction
of your fortune” betting strategy and found the optimal fraction. This
strategy is sometimes referred to as [:Kelly criteria]. As far as I know, the
dynamic programming treatment of the problem is due to @Ross1974. Ross also
considered variations where the objective was to maximize the probability of
reaching a preassigned fortune or maximizing the time until becoming broke. 

A generalization of the above model to general logarithmic and exponential
utilities is presented in @Fergurson2004.
